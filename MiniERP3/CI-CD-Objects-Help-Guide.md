# CI/CD Objects (Transport System) - Help Guide

## What are CI/CD Objects?

CI/CD Objects, also known as Transport Objects, are configuration items that move through your development pipeline from Development → QA → Production. They ensure controlled deployment of master data, configurations, and customizations across environments.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Understanding Transport Types
- **A-Series (A1-A9)**: Standard configuration and master data
- **Y-Series (Y1-Y9)**: Custom development objects  
- **Z-Series (Z1-Z9)**: Customer-specific customizations

### 2. Basic Transport Workflow
```
Development → Create Transport → Release → QA Testing → Production
```

### 3. Common Object Types in Transports
- Company Codes, Plants, Storage Locations
- Customer and Vendor master data
- Material master data
- Number ranges for all object types
- Sales organizations and pricing
- Purchase organizations and groups

## Step-by-Step: Company Code to Sales Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Company Code)
1. Create company code US01
2. Set up chart of accounts
3. Configure basic organizational structure

### Phase 2: Number Ranges
Set up number ranges for:
- **GL Accounts**: 1000000-9999999
- **Customers**: C10000-C99999
- **Vendors**: V20000-V29999
- **Assets**: A100000-A999999
- **Purchase Orders**: 4500000000-4599999999
- **Sales Orders**: SO1000000-SO1999999

### Phase 3: Organizational Structure
1. Create plants (e.g., CHI01 - Chicago)
2. Set up storage locations (RAW1, FIN1)
3. Configure sales organizations

### Phase 4: Master Data
1. Create customer master using number ranges
2. Set up vendor master data
3. Configure material master data

### Phase 5: Sales Configuration
1. Set up sales document types
2. Configure copy control (Order → Delivery)
3. Set up pricing procedures
4. Configure output types (confirmations, invoices)

## Number Range Management

### Accessing Number Ranges
Navigate to: **Configuration → Number Ranges**

### Key Number Range Types
| Object Type | Range Example | Usage |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| GL Account | 1000000-9999999 | Chart of accounts |
| Customer | C10000-C99999 | Customer numbers |
| Vendor | V20000-V29999 | Vendor numbers |
| Asset | A100000-A999999 | Fixed assets |
| Purchase Order | 4500000000+ | PO documents |
| Sales Order | SO1000000+ | Sales documents |

### Getting Next Number
The system automatically assigns the next available number when creating new objects.

## Transport Status Management

### Transport Statuses
- **MODIFIABLE**: Can add/remove objects
- **RELEASED**: Ready for deployment
- **IMPORTING**: Currently deploying
- **IMPORTED**: Successfully deployed
- **FAILED**: Deployment failed - needs attention

### QA Failure Handling
When QA deployment fails:
1. Status automatically updates to FAILED
2. Error details logged in failure analysis
3. Automatic rollback plan created
4. Notification sent to transport owner

### Checking Transport Status
1. Go to **Transports → Status Overview**
2. Filter by environment (QA/Production)
3. Review failure logs for troubleshooting

## GitHub Integration

### Connecting Repository
1. Navigate to **Settings → GitHub Integration**
2. Enter repository URL and access token
3. Test connection
4. Configure branch naming (e.g., transport/a1100001-qa)

### Automatic Branch Creation
- Each transport creates a dedicated branch
- Pull requests generated automatically
- Environment-specific deployment scripts included

## Best Practices

### Transport Planning
- Group related objects in single transport
- Plan dependency order carefully
- Document business impact
- Test in development thoroughly

### Number Range Planning
- Reserve sufficient capacity for growth
- Use meaningful prefixes (C for customers, V for vendors)
- Monitor utilization regularly
- Plan for different object categories

### Testing Strategy
- Unit test in development
- Integration test in QA
- User acceptance test before production
- Performance test for large data volumes

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Transport Fails in QA
1. Check error logs in transport status
2. Review dependency requirements
3. Verify data integrity
4. Use rollback plan if needed

### Number Range Exhausted
1. Check utilization report
2. Extend existing range or create new one
3. Update transport configuration
4. Communicate to users

### GitHub Connection Issues
1. Verify access token permissions
2. Check repository URL format
3. Test network connectivity
4. Review branch naming conventions

## Monitoring and Reports

### Transport Success Metrics
- Success rate by transport type
- Average deployment time
- Rollback frequency
- Environment sync status

### Number Range Utilization
- Current usage by object type
- Remaining capacity alerts
- Growth trend analysis
- Range exhaustion warnings

## Introduction to Master Data Management {#introduction}

### Understanding Master Data

Master data represents the critical business entities that are shared across multiple systems and processes within an organization. Unlike transactional data, which captures business events, master data defines the foundational elements that enable business operations.

#### Characteristics of Master Data

**Persistence**: Master data has a long lifecycle, often spanning years or decades. A customer record, once created, may be active for the entire duration of the business relationship.

**Shared Usage**: Master data is referenced by multiple business processes and systems. A material master record is used by procurement, inventory management, sales, and financial reporting.

**High Value**: The quality and accuracy of master data directly impacts business operations. Incorrect customer information can prevent order fulfillment; inaccurate material specifications can cause production delays.

**Change Control**: Modifications to master data require careful consideration and approval, as changes can have far-reaching impacts across the organization.

### Master Data Categories

#### Organizational Master Data
Defines the legal and operational structure of the business:
- Company codes (legal entities)
- Plants (operational locations)
- Storage locations (inventory management points)
- Sales organizations (customer-facing entities)
- Purchase organizations (vendor-facing entities)

#### Business Partner Master Data
Represents external entities that interact with the organization:
- Customers (revenue sources)
- Vendors (suppliers and service providers)
- Contact persons (relationship management)
- Address management (location and communication details)

#### Product and Material Master Data
Describes the goods and services offered or consumed:
- Material specifications and properties
- Product hierarchies and categorization
- Units of measure and conversion factors
- Lifecycle status and availability

#### Financial Master Data
Supports financial management and reporting:
- Chart of accounts structure
- Cost centers and profit centers
- GL account definitions
- Tax codes and calculation rules

### Data Quality Principles

#### Accuracy
Data must correctly represent real-world entities and their attributes. This requires:
- Validation rules to prevent incorrect data entry
- Regular verification against authoritative sources
- Correction procedures for identified inaccuracies

#### Completeness
All required data elements must be present for effective business operations:
- Mandatory field enforcement
- Data enrichment from external sources
- Regular completeness audits and gap analysis

#### Consistency
Data representations must be uniform across systems and processes:
- Standardized data formats and coding schemes
- Harmonized business rules and validation logic
- Cross-system data synchronization procedures

#### Timeliness
Data must be current and reflect the most recent information:
- Real-time or near-real-time update mechanisms
- Change notification and propagation systems
- Regular refresh cycles for external data sources

## Organizational Master Data {#organizational-data}

### Company Code Management

#### Understanding Company Codes

A company code represents a legal entity within your organizational structure. Each company code maintains its own set of financial books, operates under specific legal and regulatory requirements, and may have distinct business processes.

#### Company Code Planning Process

**Legal Structure Analysis**:
Before creating company codes, conduct thorough analysis of your legal entity structure:

1. **Regulatory Requirements**: Different jurisdictions may require separate legal entities for tax, compliance, or operational purposes.

2. **Financial Reporting**: Consider how financial consolidation and reporting will be structured across entities.

3. **Operational Independence**: Evaluate the degree of operational autonomy each entity requires.

4. **System Integration**: Determine how entities will interact within your ERP system and with external systems.

**Configuration Decisions**:

**Currency Selection**: Each company code operates in a primary currency, though multi-currency transactions are typically supported. Consider:
- Local legal requirements for financial reporting
- Operational efficiency for day-to-day transactions
- Foreign exchange risk management strategies
- Integration with global financial systems

**Chart of Accounts**: The chart of accounts defines the financial structure for the company code:
- Local GAAP requirements (US GAAP, IFRS, local standards)
- Management reporting needs
- Integration with group reporting requirements
- Flexibility for future business changes

**Fiscal Year Variant**: Defines the financial calendar for the entity:
- Calendar year vs. fiscal year considerations
- Industry-specific requirements
- Alignment with parent company reporting
- Seasonal business considerations

#### Implementation Process

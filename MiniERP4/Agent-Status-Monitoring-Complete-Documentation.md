# Agent Status Monitoring System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The Agent Status Monitoring System provides automated, color-coded status reporting for Player Agents with intelligent escalation and Coach Agent oversight. The system implements three priority levels with different update frequencies based on business criticality.

## Color-Coded Status Levels

### ðŸŸ¢ Green Status (Normal Operations)
- **Update Frequency**: Every 4 hours
- **Business Impact**: Low
- **Coach Intervention**: Not required
- **Use Cases**: Routine operations, healthy metrics, no issues

### ðŸŸ¡ Amber Status (Priority Issues)
- **Update Frequency**: Every 30 minutes (Priority Level 2)
- **Business Impact**: Medium
- **Coach Intervention**: Optional monitoring
- **Use Cases**: Issues being actively resolved, temporary delays, resource constraints

### ðŸ”´ Red Status (Critical Issues)
- **Update Frequency**: Every 1 second (Immediate)
- **Business Impact**: Critical
- **Coach Intervention**: Required
- **Use Cases**: System failures, revenue blocking issues, critical operational problems

## Automatic Escalation System

### Escalation Levels
- **Level 0**: Initial red alert
- **Level 1**: 2+ consecutive red alerts
- **Level 2**: 3+ consecutive red alerts (Critical escalation)

### Escalation Features
- Automatic persistence tracking
- Progressive escalation messaging
- Coach notification enhancement
- Business impact assessment

## Implementation Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE player_agent_status_updates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  player_agent_id UUID NOT NULL,
  coach_agent_id UUID NOT NULL,
  status_level VARCHAR(10) CHECK (status_level IN ('green', 'amber', 'red')),
  business_domain VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  status_description TEXT NOT NULL,
  issues_identified JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  resolution_progress TEXT,
  business_impact VARCHAR(20) CHECK (business_impact IN ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical')),
  requires_coach_intervention BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  consecutive_red_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  escalation_level INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Endpoints

#### Initialize Agent Monitoring
```bash
POST /api/agent-status/initialize-monitoring
{
  "playerAgentId": "agent-uuid",
  "businessDomain": "sales"
}
```

#### Send Status Update
```bash
POST /api/agent-status/status-update
{
  "playerAgentId": "agent-uuid",
  "businessDomain": "sales",
  "statusLevel": "red",
  "statusDescription": "Critical system failure",
  "issuesIdentified": ["API timeout", "Database connection lost"],
  "businessImpact": "critical",
  "requiresCoachIntervention": true
}
```

#### Get Status Overview
```bash
GET /api/agent-status/overview
# Returns: {"red": 5, "amber": 1, "green": 2, "totalAgents": 1}
```

#### Get Critical Alerts
```bash
GET /api/agent-status/critical-alerts
# Returns: Recent red status alerts with escalation details
```

## Live System Test Results

### Sales Agent Status Progression

**1. Initial Green Status**
```json
{
  "statusLevel": "green",
  "description": "Sales pipeline healthy - 15 active opportunities",
  "nextUpdate": "4 hours"
}
```

**2. Amber Status Escalation**
```json
{
  "statusLevel": "amber", 
  "description": "Customer credit verification delays affecting 3 major deals",
  "issues": ["Credit bureau API slow", "Manual verification backlog"],
  "resolutionProgress": "Escalated to finance team",
  "estimatedResolution": "24 hours"
}
```

**3. Critical Red Status**
```json
{
  "statusLevel": "red",
  "description": "CRITICAL: Payment gateway integration failure",
  "issues": ["Payment API 500 errors", "Customer orders failing", "Revenue pipeline blocked"],
  "businessImpact": "critical",
  "requiresCoachIntervention": true,
  "consecutiveAlerts": 5,
  "escalationLevel": 2
}
```

## Coach Agent Notifications

### Red Status Immediate Notification
```json
{
  "communicationType": "status_report",
  "subject": "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ESCALATION: SALES",
  "urgencyLevel": "critical",
  "message": "IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION REQUIRED\n\nStatus: Payment gateway failure\nBusiness Impact: critical\nEscalation Level: 2",
  "responseRequired": true
}
```

### Amber Status Priority Notification
```json
{
  "communicationType": "status_report", 
  "subject": "ðŸŸ¡ Priority Issue Resolution: SALES",
  "urgencyLevel": "normal",
  "message": "Issue being actively resolved\n\nProgress: Escalated to finance team\nEstimated Completion: 24 hours"
}
```

## Monitoring Features

### Automatic Persistence Tracking
- Monitors red status continuation every 1 second
- Automatically increments consecutive alert count
- Progressive escalation messaging
- Coach intervention flags

### Business Domain Coverage
- **Sales**: Pipeline issues, payment failures, customer problems
- **Finance**: Reconciliation failures, banking issues, cash flow problems  
- **Inventory**: Stock shortages, supplier delays, warehouse issues
- **Production**: Manufacturing problems, quality issues, capacity constraints

### Intelligent Escalation Logic
```javascript
// Escalation level calculation
const escalationLevel = consecutiveRedCount >= 3 ? 2 : 
                       consecutiveRedCount >= 2 ? 1 : 0;

// Enhanced messaging for persistent issues
const description = `ESCALATED: ${originalDescription} - Issue persists after ${consecutiveRedCount} alerts`;
```

## Status Dashboard Overview

### Real-Time Metrics
- **Red (Critical)**: 5 agents - Immediate action required
- **Amber (Priority)**: 1 agent - Active resolution in progress  
- **Green (Normal)**: 2 agents - Operations healthy
- **Total Monitoring**: 8 business domains covered

### Escalation Statistics
- **Critical Escalations**: Automatic after 3+ consecutive red alerts
- **Coach Interventions**: Required for all red status alerts
- **Average Resolution**: Tracked per business domain
- **Success Rate**: Monitored for continuous improvement

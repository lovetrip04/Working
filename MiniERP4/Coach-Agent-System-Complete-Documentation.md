# Coach Agent System - Complete Implementation Documentation

## System Overview

The Coach Agent system provides centralized oversight and approval authority for all Player Agent activities. Coach Agents have exclusive control over data modifications, UI changes, and configuration updates, ensuring enterprise-wide consistency and cross-domain business alignment.
